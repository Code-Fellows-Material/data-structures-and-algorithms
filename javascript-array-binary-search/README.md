## Use Binary Search methods to find the index of a value in an array
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the array’s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

- I took this whiteboard as an opportunity to learn more about recursion. I have come across it a few times but I haven't had a chance to sit down and actually use it.

  - I am unsure of the time and space complexity at this time.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

- I took the approve of using a temp variable to reverse the original array in place. 

  - Time: O(n) because the complexity grows linearly as the size does
  - Space: O(1) because we only need one additional variable to achieve our desired outcome.
